"""
In Python, a directory must contain a file named __init__.py for Python to
recognize it as a package. This file can be empty, but it can also
contain code. Its purpose is to include any initialization code that needs to
run when the package is imported. In this specific case, the utils directory
contains an __init__.py file merely to make it a package and simplify and
ensure a smooth importing of its resources as a package in other files.
