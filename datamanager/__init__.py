"""
In Python, a directory must contain a file named __init__.py for Python to
recognize it as a package. This file can be empty, but it can also
contain code. Its purpose is to include any initialization code that needs to
run when the package is imported. In our case, the datamanager directory
contains an __init__.py file to make it a package.
